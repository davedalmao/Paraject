A project management desktop application that keeps track of a project's tasks and organizes them. (Created using WPF and LocalDB)

<hr/>
  
<br/>

# Purpose
  - To know when the project can be called "DONE" 
    (by implementing the "Important functionalities" (Finish Line Tasks) first before the "Extra Features")
  - We will only implement the "Extra Features", when all the "Important Functionalities" (Finish Line Tasks) are finished AND there is still time left before the deadline
  - To focus on the priorities rather than the "Extra Features" (e.g. animations, and themes)
  - To have an organized plan when creating a project
  
<br/>
  
# Features
  - An option to manage your personal and paid projects
  - Add tasks (with categories, and priorities) to your project 
  - A filter functionality for a project's tasks, for better task organization
  - Add subtasks to a task
  - Add Notes to a project
  - Bonus: store project ideas (that can be potentially created in the future ðŸ˜‰)

# Things to Note
  - To generate the project's final output (.exe)
    - Check the Configuration (Debug or Release) and Platform (x86 (32 bit) or x64) before `Building`
    - Delete the Project's bin folder if it can't copy the .mdf or .ldf files (this project uses a service-based database)
    1. Build `Paraject.Installer` (the installer builds the project (Paraject) in its before build (located in Paraject.Installer.wixproj))
    1. Build `Paraject.Bootstrapper`
    1. The [Bootstrapper].exe is the one that packages the app's installer, and the app's prerequisite (this will serve as the final output)
  
  - If you have SqlLocalDB (2016) already installed in your machine, it will also be uninstalled if you uninstall this app. (Check your `Control Panel` to view changes)
  - This app installs SqlLocalDB.msi (2016). When the app is uninstalled your SqlLocalDB (2016) is uninstalled too.
