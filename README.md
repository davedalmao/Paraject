A project management desktop application that keeps track of a project's task and organizes them. (Created using WPF and LocalDB)

<hr/>
  
<br/>

# Purpose
  - To know when the project can be called "DONE" 
    (by implementing the "Important functionalities" (Finish Line Tasks) first before the "Extra Features")
  - We will only implement the "Extra Features", when all the "Important Functionalities" (Finish Line Tasks) are finished AND there is still time left before the deadline
  - To focus on the priorities rather than the "Extra Features" (e.g. animations, and themes)
  - To have an organized plan when creating a project
  
<br/>
  
# Features
  - An option to manage your personal and paid projects
  - Add tasks (with categories, and priorities) to your project 
  - A filter functionality for a project's tasks, for better task organization
  - Add subtasks to a task
  - Add Notes to a project
  - Bonus: store project ideas (that can be potentially created in the future ðŸ˜‰)
